A program to simplify a biology class assignment. 
Finds the longest common subsequence within a given random sequence, with error checkings, then finds longest gene that ultimately becomes an amino acid sequence.

The procedures are as follows:

1. Read in a DNA sequence from the user, given from 5’ to 3’
2. Generate the complementary strand of the sequence
3. Find the longest possible gene of the DNA
4. Transcribe the longest into mRNA, and then into an amino acid sequence
